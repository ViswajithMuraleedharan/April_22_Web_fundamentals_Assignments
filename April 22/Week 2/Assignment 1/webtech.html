        <h3>Html</h3>
        <p>
           Html is a markup or presentation language. Html is used to structure the contents in a webpage. The full form of HTML is "Hyper Text Markup Language". Html contains certain functions called elements which are used to structure the web page. The elements in a html code has to follow certain format called tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 7 basic elements used in html. These are heading element, paragragh element, division element, table element, image element etc. Each of these elements have their own unique formats called tags. An element in Html may have one or more than one tags. Eg, the heading element has 6 tags from h1 to h6, while paragraph element has only one tag. The tags are assigned in <,>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also add certain properties in an html element , these properties are called attributes. the attributes are given in key-value format. These attributes can also be used to call the element from body to head so as to style them. Eg, for image element we can call it using {src="" height="" width=""}. Here we can assign width and height as well as address to the image.The attributes are assigned in the open bracket of the tag.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            CSS is a styling language. It is used to style the components in a web page. The full form of CSS is "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS is used to style the contents in a web page. CSS contains certain functions called properties which are used to style the contents. CSS code is located in the head part of the html code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic properties used in CSS code are color, border, background-color, margin, padding, border-radius etc. Every property in a CSS code is in key value format where the key is the property name and value is the value for the key. Key and value is separated by ':'.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
